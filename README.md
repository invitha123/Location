In this project, I have used React JS along with Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, I have integrated Google Maps for location functionality. To maintain a clean and organized code structure, I have created four distinct components.
# Location Flow Assignment

This project is a Location/Address Flow application that enables users to select and save their delivery location using the Google Maps API. The application is built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It features location search, geolocation functionality, and address management.

## Features

- **Location Permission Request**: Users are prompted to enable location permissions or search for their address manually.
- **Geolocation & Pin Selection**: Users can find and fine-tune their location using a map pin.
- **Delivery Address Form**: Allows users to input specific address details (e.g., House/Flat No., Area) and categorize the address (Home, Office, etc.).
- **Address Management**: Users can manage saved addresses, update or delete them, and select them for delivery.
- **Locate Me**: Automatically find the userâ€™s current location.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Handles scenarios like location permission denial or invalid addresses.

## Bonus Features

- Save as Favorite for frequently used locations.
- Address validation to ensure accurate location data.
- Map Preview button for quick address previews.
